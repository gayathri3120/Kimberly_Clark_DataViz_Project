Optimizing Tissue Mill Locations

Overview

This project provides a strategic, data-driven approach to identifying optimal locations for tissue mills. It integrates comprehensive datasets to ensure operational efficiency, reduce transportation costs, and enhance market accessibility.

Inspiration

Traditional site selection is slow and biased, often relying on intuition rather than concrete data. Recognizing the need for speed and accuracy in decision-making inspired our team to leverage real-time, data-driven methodologies.

Project Description

The core objective was to strategically place tissue mills within a 500-mile radius of major U.S. metropolitan areas to efficiently meet regional demand. We focused specifically on areas with high tissue consumption—Southeast (25%), Farwest (17%), and Mideast (15%).

Data Sources

Census ACS Data:

DP02: Selected Social Characteristics

DP03: Selected Economic Characteristics

DP05: Demographic and Housing Estimates

Timber Availability: Forisk's Report (2023)

Tissue Consumption: US Bureau of Economic Analysis (2024)

Methodology

Data Integration: Merged ACS metrics with timber and consumption data using geographic identifiers.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned datasets, addressed missing values, and normalized features for consistency.

Composite Scoring: Calculated scores based on timber availability, population density, and regional demand.

Top Identified Locations

Atlanta, GA: Strategic connectivity to East Coast and Midwest.

Portland-Vancouver: Effective West Coast coverage.

Jackson, MS: Cost-effective access to Southern and Central regions.

Challenges

Harmonizing datasets with varying metrics and formats.

Refining weighting systems to accurately reflect strategic priorities.

Accomplishments

Development of a robust, unbiased, data-driven location model.

Identification of key strategic locations providing actionable insights.

Key Learnings

Importance of data quality and preprocessing in strategic decision-making.

Effective use of composite scoring to simplify complex data-driven decisions.

Next Steps

Implement and refine the model using updated data.

Extend the analytical framework to other strategic operations within Kimberly Clark.

Usage

Open the Tableau workbook in tableau/
